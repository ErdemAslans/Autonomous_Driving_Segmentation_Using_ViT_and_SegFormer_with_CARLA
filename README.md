# Autonomous_Driving_Segmentation_Using_ViT_and_SegFormer_with_Enhanced_Attention_Mechanisms
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for color map segmentation using a combination of Vision Transformer (ViT) and SegFormer models. It leverages advanced architectures to perform multi-class segmentation tasks based on color maps.
